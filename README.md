## Solving the Hydrogen Atom Schrödinger Equation with a Physics-Informed Neural Network
The notebook in this repo trains a physics-informed neural network to find the solution to the ground state Hydrogen atom Schrodinger equation. A full writeup of the theory and results of this implementation can be found at https://kylerofharrison.com/pinn_p2/pinn_p2.html. Results may vary.
